# Tumor Detection

This repository contains a deep learning model for tumor detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained to classify medical images as either "Tumor" or "Non-Tumor" based on their visual characteristics.


## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

The tumor detection model is built using a CNN architecture, which is a type of deep neural network particularly effective for image-based tasks. The CNN consists of multiple layers that learn hierarchical representations of the input images.

The CNN architecture used in this project includes convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The convolutional layers apply filters to extract meaningful features from the input images. The max-pooling layers downsample the features to reduce dimensionality and capture important patterns. The fully connected layers act as a classifier, making the final tumor classification predictions.
## How it Works

**Data Preparation:** The model requires a dataset of labeled medical images, with "Tumor" and "Non-Tumor" samples organized into separate folders. 



**Model Training:** The model is trained using the labeled dataset. During training, the model learns to recognize patterns and features that differentiate tumor and non-tumor images. The training process involves adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the prediction error.


**Model Evaluation:** After training, the model is evaluated using a separate set of test images. The evaluation metrics, such as accuracy and precision, provide insights into the model's performance.

**Tumor Detection:** Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to classify new, unseen medical images as "Tumor" or "Non-Tumor". The model analyzes the visual characteristics of the input image and makes predictions based on the learned patterns.
